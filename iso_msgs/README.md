# ISO messages

This ROS package contains custom ROS messages for ISO22133 used by ros2_isoobject in order to initialize the coordinate_transform node with OSEM from ATOS. It does not have any dependencies but both of the previously mentioned packages depend on this and should include it in their docker environments.
